Hi! I'm a final year undergrad in [SJTU (Shanghai Jiaotong university)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and Prof. Yu Cheng. I am interested in natural language processing and machine learning.  Currently, I am focused on Hallucination and truthness of LLM.
