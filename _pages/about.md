Hi! I graduated from [SJTU (Shanghai Jiaotong University)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2024.6. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) during my undergraduate period.
I am also a first year PhD candidate at [HKUST NLP](https://github.com/hkust-nlp) supervised by Junxian He!


I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning.  Currently, I am focused on 

* Hallucination in VLM
* Hallucination and truthfulness of LLM from an interpretability perspective.
